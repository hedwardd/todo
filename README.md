# Rumer

This app allows users to create and save a list of to-dos which are ordered by due date and can be marked as complete.

The project was built with a Node/Express backend, a React frontend, and Postgres for the database.

## Roadmap

Regarding features, I'd like to implement the ability to delete tasks instead of just marking them as complete as well as editing tasks names and due dates, ideally with in-line editing.
